## Project Description <a name="description"></a>

In this project I utilize some of my HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal
Blog Website, that includes images, layout, and styling.   


## Project Components <a name="components"></a>

Main components of this project are the images, HTML, and CSS files used to design
the Website's Front End. There are two HTML files related to:
<ul>
<li> The Blog Website: index.html </li>
<li> an example Blog Post: blog-post.html </li>
</ul>
As well as the related CSS files for responsive layout and styling:

<ul>
<li> layout.css </li>
<li> style.css </li>
<li> blog-post.css </li>
<li> post-style.css </li>
</ul>

## Instructions<a name="instructions"></a>

From the main blog website, click on <strong>Read More</strong> and the blog Post
template will show up, from there you can come back to the main page by clicking
on the <strong>HOME</strong> button.
